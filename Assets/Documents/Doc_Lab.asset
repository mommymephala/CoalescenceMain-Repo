  - Text: "Stasis Field Generation - Technical Explanation:\r\nThe prototype body
      incorporates an intricate biotechnological mechanism engineered to manipulate
      gravitons, the elementary particles responsible for gravitational force. This
      manipulation results in the creation of a localized stasis field, altering
      the conventional properties of time and space within its confines.\r"

  - Text: "Mechanism of Action:\r\nThe neural network of the prototype integrates
      nano-scale biotechnological implants, meticulously designed to initiate and
      regulate graviton flux. Through the emission of precise graviton oscillations,
      the prototype induces a distortion in the spacetime continuum, thus generating
      a stasis field. This field acts as a temporal inhibitor, decelerating temporal
      progression within its defined parameters.\r"

  - Text: "Application and Control:\r\nActivation of the stasis field demands a concerted
      mental effort from the prototype, necessitating focused concentration and cognitive
      command. The field's influence is strictly localized, affecting solely the
      immediate vicinity of the prototype. Its utility lies in its capacity to impose
      temporary halts or deceleration upon the activities and responses of entities
      within its sphere, providing strategic advantages across diverse scenarios.\r"
