  - Text: "A quote from an ancient tome:\r\n\n\u201CGreat are the stars, and man
      is of no account to them. But man is a fair spirit, whom a star conceived,
      and a star kills. He is greater than those bright blind companies. For though
      in them there is incalculable potentiality, in him there is achievement, small,
      but actual. Too soon, seemingly, he comes to his end. But when he is done he
      will not be nothing, not as though he had never been; for he is eternally a
      beauty in the eternal form of things.\u201D\r"
