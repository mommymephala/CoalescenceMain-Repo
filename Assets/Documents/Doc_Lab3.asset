  - Text: "Date: [Redacted for Security]\r\n\nToday, I conducted an examination of
      the prototype in the experimental chamber. It's designed to manipulate gravity
      and create stasis fields, which is pretty intriguing. However, its behaviour
      isn't exactly what we anticipated.\r\nWhile it's proficient in generating stasis
      fields, it seems to struggle with social interaction. This discrepancy raises
      questions about its overall functionality and purpose. As we delve deeper into
      its psychological evaluations, it's evident that there are underlying factors
      influencing its behaviour. We'll continue our investigations to uncover the
      truth behind these anomalies.\r"
