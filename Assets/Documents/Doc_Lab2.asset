  - Text: "Limitations and Safety Protocols:\r\nThe substantial energy requisites
      inherent in graviton manipulation impose constraints on the sustainable duration
      of the stasis field. Prolonged utilization poses the risk of imposing significant
      metabolic strain on the prototype's physiological framework. In response, the
      prototype features integrated feedback sensors, tasked with monitoring physiological
      responses and initiating automatic field deactivation upon surpassing critical
      thresholds. The exposed biochips designed to relay data to these sensors necessitate
      further refinement.\r"

  - Text: "Future Prospects:\r\nThe advent of stasis field generation heralds promising
      avenues in the domain of human augmentation. Though presently confined to the
      prototype, ongoing research endeavours hold the potential for broader applications,
      encompassing realms such as medical intervention and emergency response frameworks.\r"
